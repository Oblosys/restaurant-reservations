Restaurant reservations
=======================

A small web application for managing reservations at a restaurant. It consists of a calendar page for viewing and managing reservations, as well as a page that clients can use to make new reservations. Everything is updated in real time, so if a client considers making a reservation on a certain day, and a time slot on that day is filled by someone else, the corresponding button in the client app is immediately disabled. The implementation uses the JQuery, Backbone, Underscore, Node.js, Express, and Socket.io libraries, and has a generic storage layer that can use either MySQL or JSON.
