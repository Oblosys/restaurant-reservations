<h2>Reservations web app</h2>
The web application on this page can be used to manage reservations at a fictitious restaurant. The <a href="index.html">Calendar</a> page is intended for the restaurant staff, whereas clients can use the <a href="reservation.html">Reservation</a> page to make new reservations.
<h2>Features</h2>
In the calendar view, you can click on days or use the arrow keys to view the reservations for that day. The blue numbers are the number of reservations for that day with the total number of people between parentheses. You can switch between the calendar and day views by using the tab key. The selected reservation may be modified by pressing the Edit button.
<p>
The reservation view dynamically shows which time slots are still available. If you select the number of people and the date, only the buttons for available time slots are enabled. (The maximum number of customers per slot is 12.)
<p>
All information is updated in real time. If you open a second <a target="_blank" href="index.html">Calendar</a> or <a target="_blank" href="reservation.html">Reservation</a> page in a separate browser window (or on a mobile device), all edit operations on the reservations, as well as newly made reservations, immediately show up on all pages.
