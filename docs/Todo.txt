// from comments in calendar.js
 * mention that Day propagates events from collection
 * 
 * mention selection
 * 
 * add  / remove
 * why doesn't date change to next month not cause an addition in other calendar the views the next month?
 * handle date change by remove/add? What if it is not inside the range? 

// TODO: id reservationView + class res. view?  fix missing closing tag. use id for month.

// TODO: handle reservations + handlers (note: maybe this has been done already)
function setSelectedYearMonth() {

    this.listenTo(selection, "change:day", this.renderSelection);
    // causes lot of events on selection (one to each cell), but is elegant. TODO: optimize single event? 






// fix nonexisting database
// maybe turn off socket.io debug info

// -find a way to open a socket to node.oblomov.com (instead of server.oblomov.com:8200)
// When deleting an edited reservation, the next one is being edited. better to cancel editing
// TODO: inline todos
// use success/fail continuations instead of explicit html stuff in db-mysql and db-json 
// check c.end() calls. Make sure that connection is closed in function that creates it.

// Keyboard navigation with arrows + view focus with tab and shift-tab 
// TODO: editable reservations: 
//         offer to cancel on unintended navigation?
//         check if reservation is dirty before offering save
//         date change (might be trickier)
// TODO: check IE and iOS and windows, etc.
// TODO: make some log functions for collections and models
- at least, check util.log arg for collection or model and print elts or props (prevents hanging when cyclic models are logged)
- add type prop to each backbone object and put all set properties in a json object
// TODO: maybe cache viewed months?
// TODO: check http://ozkatz.github.io/avoiding-common-backbonejs-pitfalls.html

- Share model between client and server code?
